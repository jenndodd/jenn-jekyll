<h3>What I Value</h3>
<ul>
  <li>People over process</li>
  <li>Learning over knowing</li>
  <li>Problems over requirements</li>
  <li>Collaboration over silos</li>
  <li>Design decisions over design deliverables</li>
  <li>Communication over documentation</li>
  <li>Design leadership over design ownership</li>
  <li>Launched over perfect</li>
  <li>Puppies over kittens (sorry, not sorry)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>I am a user centered, full stack product designer.</p>  
<img src="/images/css.gif" class="about-pics" />
<p>To me, "Full stack product designer" includes:</p> 

<ul>
  <li>User Research and Usability Testing</li>
  <li>Domain modeling</li> 
  <li>Information architecture</li> 
  <li>User experience design</li>
  <li>Visual and User Interface design</li>
  <li>Technical implementation/communication of design - in my case, that often means frontend coding (I might be the only person in the world who loves CSS) - but what this is really getting at is technical literacy.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/collaborate.gif" class="about-pics" />
<p>I love working fast and lean within cross-disciplined, agile teams. For me, it's all about people.</p> 

<p>As a designer, I see myself as an advocate for the user and I always work towards striking a balance between their needs and the needs of the business. I get there through cross-discipline collaboration, product-level and feature-level validation, and usability testing. My ultimate goal is learning and iterating towards a valuable, usable, and beautiful product.</p>

<img src="/images/feedback.gif" class="about-pics" />
<p>As a manager, I'm passionate about growing and supporting people and teams. Consistent feedback and open communication is key. I help others identify and set goals, then step back and support and enable her or him in achieving them.</p>

<p>As a human, I enjoy a wide variety of things. You will always find me with a book (or three), and I love to write and take creative writing classes in my free time. I'm always game for cooking new recipes but, while The Great British Bake Off <img src="/images/mary-berry.gif" class="about-pics" /> is adorable and inspires me, I think I will always hate to bake. <strong>I love gifs.</strong> And gin. I'm a maker at heart and love to experiment with new mediums and tools. If you like, you can check out some of my side projects on <a href="www.jenndodd.com">my other website.</a></p>
