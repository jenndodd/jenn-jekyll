  <h1>I love puppies</h1>

  <p>Just thought you should know that. Now that we got that out of the way...</p>

  <p>A long time ago, I wrote this haiku and I still think it stands.</p>
  <p>Like an artichoke,</p>
  <p>I have a glorious heart,</p>
  <p>And lots of layers.</p>

  <h2>TLDR</h2>
  
  <p> My path to product design has been a meandering one, with all of the layers I've collected finally making sense when finally put together.<p>

  <h2>Life Story</h2>

  <p>My first experiences with UX happened when I was studying interior design. It's facinating how many similarities and correlations can be made between a user interacting with an app, and a user interacting with a space.</p>

  <p>Not too far off from graduating, I took a typography class as an elective and fell absolutely head over heels for typography and graphic design. I like to think of letters as the tiniest form of architecture. I still practice lettering and you can find sheets upon sheets of hand drawn fonts and alphabets around my desk.</p>

  <p>After graduating, I got to work as a furniture designer and draftsperson for a shop that specialized in museum quality Art Deco furniture pieces. I got to be surrounded by beautiful forms, exotic materials, and some of the most talented woodworkers in the world. At night, I spent my time learning Illustrator and Photoshop so that I could follow my growing love of graphic design. It's around this time I built my first webpage. It featured a tiger, a table, and hover states on ALL THE THINGS. Who needs taste?</p>

  <p>After a year or so, I switched gears and started working as a UI designer for a software development company. Over the next 3+ years I dove deeper into code, learned a ton about web design, agile development, and how painful and poor product design could be if users were usurped by requirements documents.</p>

  <p>I took a bit of time and did General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. In many ways, code felt like CAD. Hours could disappear in seconds. I was consumed. My heart swells a little when I see a text editor and I loved building something "real." Here I learned how to think like a developer and it gave me the vocabulary to have more meaningful conversations with technical people. Much like visiting a foreign country, just making the attempt to speak the native language will reduce the "us" vs "them," foster empathy, understanding, collaboration, and conversation... even if all you know is "Hello world." </p>

  <p>Then I got this sweet gig at Pivotal Labs where it's been sunshine, rainbows, and design unicorns ever since.</p> 

  <p>JK, lolz. Even in a user centered wonderland filled with some of the smartest and empathetic people ever, every day is still hard. I often think "You know nothing, Jenn Dodd." Design is hard. Talking about design is hard. Advocating for the user is hard. Fixing merge conflicts is hard. Consulting is <span class="em-ital">wicked</span> hard. But nothing has ever been so rewarding, enlightening, or humbling.</p>
